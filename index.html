            "Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human
            knowledge. That's what we're doing." â€” Jimmy Wales

            Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and millions already have.

            Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by presenting information on all branches of knowledge. Hosted by
            the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikipedia consists of freely editable content, with articles that often contain
            numerous links guiding readers to more information.

            Written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers known as Wikipedians, Wikipedia articles can be
            edited by anyone with Internet access, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent
            disruption or vandalism. Since its creation on January 15, 2001, it has grown into the world's largest
            reference website, attracting over a billion visitors each month. Wikipedia currently has more than
            sixty-three million articles in more than 300 languages, including 6,886,397 articles in English, with
            116,686 active contributors in the past month.

            Wikipedia's fundamental principles are summarized in its five pillars. While the Wikipedia community has
            developed many policies and guidelines, new editors do not need to be familiar with them before they start
            contributing.

            Anyone can edit Wikipedia's text, references, and images. The quality of content is more important than who
            contributes it. The content must conform with Wikipedia's policies, including being verifiable by published
            reliable sources. Contributions based on personal opinions, beliefs, personal experiences, unreviewed
            research, libellous material, and copyright violations are not allowed and will not remain. Wikipedia's
            software allows easy reversal of errors, and experienced editors watch and patrol bad edits.

            Wikipedia differs from printed references in important ways. It is continually created and updated, and
            encyclopedic articles on news events appear within minutes, making it more dynamic than most traditional
            resources. Anyone can improve Wikipedia, and over 23-years of volunteer editors giving their time and
            talents to the project have made Wikipedia history's most comprehensive encyclopedia. Its editors add
            quality and quantity, remove misinformation, and fix errors and vandalism. The sources they provide are used
            by researchers worldwide (see Researching with Wikipedia).

            In summary, Wikipedia has tested the wisdom of the crowd since 2001, and found that it succeeds.</p>
